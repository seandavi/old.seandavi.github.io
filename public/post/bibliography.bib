  abstract    = "Obtaining accurate drug response data in large cohorts of
                 cancer patients is very challenging; thus, most cancer
                 pharmacogenomics discovery is conducted in preclinical
                 studies, typically using cell lines and mouse models. However,
                 these platforms suffer from serious limitations, including
                 small sample sizes. Here, we have developed a novel
                 computational method that allows us to impute drug response in
                 very large clinical cancer genomics data sets, such as The
                 Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The approach works by creating
                 statistical models relating gene expression to drug response
                 in large panels of cancer cell lines and applying these models
                 to tumor gene expression data in the clinical data sets (e.g.,
                 TCGA). This yields an imputed drug response for every drug in
                 each patient. These imputed drug response data are then
                 associated with somatic genetic variants measured in the
                 clinical cohort, such as copy number changes or mutations in
                 protein coding genes. These analyses recapitulated drug
                 associations for known clinically actionable somatic genetic
                 alterations and identified new predictive biomarkers for
                 existing drugs.",

                 genome bears the cumulative effects of mutational processes
                 during tumor development. Deciphering mutational signatures in
                 cancer is a new topic in cancer research. The Wellcome Trust
                 Sanger Institute (WTSI) has categorized 30 reference
                 signatures in the COSMIC database based on the analyses of âˆ¼10
                 000 sequencing datasets from TCGA and ICGC. Large cohorts and
                 bioinformatics skills are required to perform the same
                 analysis as WTSI. The quantification of known signatures in
                 custom cohorts is not possible under the current framework of
                 the COSMIC database, which motivates us to construct a
                 database for mutational signatures in cancers and make such

                 TCGA/ICGC cancer projects, making comparison of signature

  abstract = "Gene expression analysis provides genome-wide insights into the
              transcriptional activity of a cell. One of the first
              computational steps in exploration and analysis of the gene
              expression data is clustering. With a number of standard
              clustering methods routinely used, most of the methods do not
              take prior biological information into account. In this paper, we
              propose a new approach for gene expression clustering analysis.
              The approach benefits from a new deep learning architecture,
              Robust Autoencoder, which provides a more accurate high-level
              representation of the feature sets, and from incorporating prior
              biological information into the clustering process. We tested our
              approach on two distinct gene expression datasets and compared
              the performance with two widely used clustering methods,
              hierarchical clustering and k-means, as well as with a recent
              deep learning clustering approach. As a result, our approach
              outperformed all other clustering methods on the labeled yeast
              gene expression dataset. Furthermore we showed that it is better
              in identifying the functionally common clusters than k-means on
              the unlabeled human gene expression dataset. The results
              demonstrate that our new deep learning architecture could
              generalize well the specific properties of gene expression
              profiles. Furthermore, the results confirm our hypothesis that
              the prior biological network knowledge could be helpful in the

  abstract = "3C-like experiments, such as 4C or Hi-C, have been fundamental in
              understanding genome organization. Thanks to these technologies,
              it is now known, for example, that Topologically Associating
              Domains (TADs) and chromatin loops are implicated in the dynamic
              interplay of gene activation and repression, and their disruption
              can have dramatic effects on embryonic development. To make their
              detection easier, scientists have endeavored into deeper
              sequencing to mechanically increase the chances to detect weaker
              signals such as chromatin loops. Part of this mindset can be
              attributed to the limitations of existing software: the analysis
              of Hi-C experiments is both statistically and computationally
              demanding. Here, we devise a new way to represent Hi-C data,
              which leads to a more detailed classification of paired-end reads
              and, ultimately, to a new normalization and interaction detection

              complex traits associated with heritable common mutations is an
              ongoing effort. The primary challenge involves identifying the
              relevant cell types and the causal variants among the vast
              majority of the associated mutations in the noncoding regions. To
              address this challenge, we developed an efficient probabilistic
              framework. First, we propose a sparse group-guided learning
              algorithm to infer cell-type-specific enrichments. Second, we

              Bayesian priors the sparse enrichments to infer risk variants.
              Using the proposed framework to analyze 32 complex human traits
              revealed meaningful tissue-specific epigenomic enrichments

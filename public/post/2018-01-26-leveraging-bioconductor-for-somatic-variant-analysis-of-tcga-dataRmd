The [NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC)] now contains the authoritative
source of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as well as several
other projects of import to the cancer research community. One of the
available assays produces somatic variant calls, formally identified
by comparing tumor reads and normal reads to identify variants
relative to the human reference genome that are not present in the
normal genome of the patient. Unfortunately, this process for
discovering these variants is less precise relative to finding
germline variants. Because a gold standard bioinformatics approach for
somatic variant calling has not been identified, the GDC runs four
separate pipelines and has two levels of data for each. This post
demonstrates the use of the Bioconductor [GenomicDataCommons package]
to identify and then fetch somatic variant results from the NCI GDC
and then provide a high-level assessment of those variants using the
[maftools package]. The workflow will be:

1. Install packages if not already installed
2. Load libraries
3. Identify and download somatic variants for a representative TCGA
dataset, in this case cutaneous melanoma.
4. Use maftools to provide rich summaries of the data.


Identifying appropriate resources at the GDC starts with a bit of
browsing on the website or with equivalent browsing using one of the
GenomicDataCommons introspection functions, `available_fields()` and
`available_values()`.

To work through these code examples, the maftools and
GenomicDataCommons packages must first be installed. 

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(c("GenomicDataCommons", "maftools")
```

Once installed, load the packages, as usual.

```{r load}
library(GenomicDataCommons)
library(maftools)
```

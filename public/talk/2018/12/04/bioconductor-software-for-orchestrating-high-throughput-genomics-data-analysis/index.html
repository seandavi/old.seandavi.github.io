<h2>Reproducible research</h2>
<ul>
<li>Everything in bioconductor is version controlled and versioned.</li>
<li>Package build system guarantees compatibility between packages.</li>
<li>Documentation and workflows are “literate”, so if they do not work or do not match code, Bioc build system alerts developer.</li>
<li>Strong reliance on interoperability to reduce “reinvention” (and decrease mistakes)</li>

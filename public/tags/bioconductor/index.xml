      <description>One of the main features of the annual [Bioconductor Conference] is the proportion of time spent working with code in the form of [workshops]. To support these workshops, we ask workshop presenters to supply Rmarkdown materials which we collate into workshop materials. Using literate programming approaches like Rmarkdown ensures that the workflows are self-consistent and work as expected.
In addition to the Rmarkdown workshop materials, we also need a consistent computing environment that can support reasonably large computation, provide high-performance network and file system access, and is essentially unlimited in scale (we expect to have &amp;gt;150 participants, each with his/her own machine).</description>

      <title>A computable Bioconductor build report</title>

      <description>Bioconductor spends a substantial amount of effort to build its catalog of software each day. Reporting of these results is critical for developers, users, and project leaders to understand the software “health” of the project.
The Bioconductor build reports are generally available as html pages that are navigable with bookmarks and link out to detailed reports of errors, etc. However, the build reports are not readily computable, so mining the reports, automated processing by developers, and learning about failure modes automatically is challenging.</description>

      <description>Introduction The NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC) is a reboot of the approach that NCI uses to manage and expose genomic and associated clinical and experimental metadata. I have been working on a Bioconductor package that interfaces with the GDC API to provide search and data retrieval from within R.
testing In the first of what will likely be a set of use cases for the GenomicDataCommons, I am going to address a question that came up on twitter from @sleight82</description>

      <title>The GenomicDataCommons Package</title>

      <description>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has established the Genomic Data Commons (GDC). The GDC provides the cancer research community with an open and unified repository for sharing and accessing data across numerous cancer studies and projects via a high-performance data transfer and query infrastructure. The GenomicDataCommons Bioconductor package provides basic infrastructure for querying, accessing, and mining genomic datasets available from the GDC. We expect that the Bioconductor developer and the larger bioinformatics communities will build on the GenomicDataCommons package to add higher-level functionality and expose cancer genomics data to the plethora of state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods available in Bioconductor.</description>

      <description>One of the features of the NCI Genomic Data Commons is that everything has a unique identifier in the form of a UUID. However, because many legacy projects and much of the literature do not use UUIDs but instead use TCGA sample barcodes, one simple use case for the GenomicDataCommons package is to map from the UUID for a file or a set of files back to the associated TCGA barcode(s).</description>

      <description>As a government employee, I have been given some fantastic opportunities to interact with other government employees and agencies doing really important research in service to the country. Over the past couple of days, I have been attending a great symposium to provide an updated Blueprint for animal genetics and genomics. Discussion was wide-ranging, but largely focused on genomics, informatics, and translation to and from phenotypes. High-throughput phenotyping (think wearables for plants and cows and drone videos of cattle herds) seems like a growth area.</description>

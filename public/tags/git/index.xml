      <description>The prelude I made a mistake and am going to share it here. Please be gentle when judging me on it&amp;hellip;.
I had been working on some code that I thought was going to be throw-away example code for loading a large dataset into ElasticSearch. That said, I have been saved often enough by using a version control system (now, always git), that I use it all the time. &amp;ldquo;Knowing&amp;rdquo; that this code would never be shared, I was careless and included my [Amazon Web Service (AWS)] [keys] in the code while I sorted out whether [logstash] would pick up the keys from a central config file.</description>

      <description>As a government employee, I have been given some fantastic opportunities to interact with other government employees and agencies doing really important in service to the country. Over the past couple of days, I have been attending a great symposium to provide an updated Blueprint for animal genetics and genomics. Discussion was wide-ranging, but largely focused on genomics, informatics, and translation to and from phenotypes. High-throughput phenotyping (think wearables for plants and cows and drone videos of cattle herds) seems like a growth area.</description>

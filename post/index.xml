      <description>As a government employee, I have been given some fantastic opportunities to interact with other government employees and agencies doing really important in service to the country. Over the past couple of days, I have been attending a great symposium to provide an updated Blueprint for animal genetics and genomics. Discussion was wide-ranging, but largely focused on genomics, informatics, and translation to and from phenotypes. High-throughput phenotyping (think wearables for plants and cows and drone videos of cattle herds) seems like a growth area.</description>

      <description>I have been attending the biannual Clinical Informatics for Cancer Centers (CI4CC) conference and there has been a fair amount of dicussion of ClinicalTrials.gov as a resource for enhancing patient engagement, trial recruitment, and results reporting. There are a number of approaches to search and access in bulk ClinicalTrials.gov data. The ones that I address here are:
The CTRP RESTful API. The ClinicalTrials.gov API. The Access to Aggregate Content of ClinicalTrials.</description>

      <description>Introduction The NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC) is a reboot of the approach that NCI uses to manage and expose genomic and associated clinical and experimental metadata. I have been working on a Bioconductor package that interfaces with the GDC API to provide search and data retrieval from within R.
testing In the first of what will likely be a set of use cases for the GenomicDataCommons, I am going to address a question that came up on twitter from @sleight82</description>

# Biography

I am a pediatric oncologist in the National Cancer Institute at the
National Institutes of Health. My research and collaborations span
biomedical and genomic data science, open data approaches in cancer
research, and software development and engineering. My interest in the
interplay among data science, data engineering, and big data
approaches in science has lead to my involvement in cloud-based data
commons efforts. Finally, I have organized and taught several courses
and tutorials in data science, programming, and genomics.

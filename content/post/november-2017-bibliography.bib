  abstract    = "Metastatic breast cancer remains challenging to treat, and
                 most patients ultimately progress on therapy. This acquired
                 drug resistance is largely due to drug-refractory
                 sub-populations (subclones) within heterogeneous tumors. Here,
                 we track the genetic and phenotypic subclonal evolution of
                 four breast cancers through years of treatment to better
                 understand how breast cancers become drug-resistant.
                 Recurrently appearing post-chemotherapy mutations are rare.
                 However, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing reveal
                 acquisition of malignant phenotypes after treatment, including
                 enhanced mesenchymal and growth factor signaling, which may
                 promote drug resistance, and decreased antigen presentation
                 and TNF-$\alpha$ signaling, which may enable immune system
                 avoidance. Some of these phenotypes pre-exist in pre-treatment
                 subclones that become dominant after chemotherapy, indicating
                 selection for resistance phenotypes. Post-chemotherapy cancer
                 cells are effectively treated with drugs targeting acquired
                 phenotypes. These findings highlight cancer's ability to
                 evolve phenotypically and suggest a phenotype-targeted
                 treatment strategy that adapts to cancer as it evolves.",

                 increasingly popular as machine learning tools during the
                 recent years. The availability of greater computational
                 resources, more data, new algorithms for training deep models
                 and easy to use libraries for implementation and training of
                 neural networks are the drivers of this development. The use
                 of deep learning has been especially successful in image
                 recognition; and the development of tools, applications and
                 code examples are in most cases centered within this field
                 rather than within biology. Results: Here, we aim to further
                 the development of deep learning methods within biology by
                 providing application examples and ready to apply and adapt
                 code templates. Given such examples, we illustrate how
                 architectures consisting of convolutional and long short-term
                 memory neural networks can relatively easily be designed and
                 trained to state-of-the-art performance on three biological

  abstract    = "Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology,
                 such as RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) required hundreds of
                 thousands of cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent
                 technical advances permit genome-wide gene expression
                 measurement at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-Seq
                 (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications
                 are based on data produced with this technology. However,
                 RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly different. In
                 particular, unlike RNA-seq, the majority of reported
                 expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be
                 either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the
                 time of measurement, or technically-driven, genes expressing
                 RNA, but not at a sufficient level to be detected by
                 sequencing technology. Another difference is that the
                 proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero
                 varies substantially across single cells compared to RNA-seq
                 samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this
                 cell-to-cell variation is being driven by technical rather
                 than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic
                 errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as
                 a major challenge in high-throughput technologies, these
                 issues have received minimal attention in published studies
                 based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment
                 experiment to examine data from published studies and
                 demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial
                 percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability.
                 Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported
                 zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that
                 scRNA-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias
                 is greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this
                 missing data problem is exacerbated by the fact that this
                 technical variation varies cell-to-cell. Then, we show how
                 this technical cell-to-cell variability can be confused with
                 novel biological results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss
                 how batch-effects and confounded experiments can intensify the
                 problem.",

                 however, the understanding of the causative biological
                 processes generating these mutations is limited. A cancer
                 genome bears the cumulative effects of mutational processes
                 during tumor development. Deciphering mutational signatures in
                 cancer is a new topic in cancer research. The Wellcome Trust
                 Sanger Institute (WTSI) has categorized 30 reference
                 signatures in the COSMIC database based on the analyses of ∼10
                 000 sequencing datasets from TCGA and ICGC. Large cohorts and
                 bioinformatics skills are required to perform the same
                 analysis as WTSI. The quantification of known signatures in
                 custom cohorts is not possible under the current framework of
                 the COSMIC database, which motivates us to construct a
                 database for mutational signatures in cancers and make such
                 analyses more accessible to general researchers. mSignatureDB
                 (http://tardis.cgu.edu.tw/msignaturedb) integrates R packages
                 and in-house scripts to determine the contributions of the
                 published signatures in 15 780 individual tumors from 73
                 TCGA/ICGC cancer projects, making comparison of signature
                 patterns within and between projects become possible.
                 mSignatureDB also allows users to perform signature analysis
                 on their own datasets, quantifying contributions of signatures
                 at sample resolution, which is a unique feature of
                 mSignatureDB not available in other related databases.",

  abstract = "Gene expression analysis provides genome-wide insights into the
              transcriptional activity of a cell. One of the first
              computational steps in exploration and analysis of the gene
              expression data is clustering. With a number of standard
              clustering methods routinely used, most of the methods do not
              take prior biological information into account. In this paper, we
              propose a new approach for gene expression clustering analysis.
              The approach benefits from a new deep learning architecture,
              Robust Autoencoder, which provides a more accurate high-level
              representation of the feature sets, and from incorporating prior
              biological information into the clustering process. We tested our
              approach on two distinct gene expression datasets and compared
              the performance with two widely used clustering methods,
              hierarchical clustering and k-means, as well as with a recent
              deep learning clustering approach. As a result, our approach
              outperformed all other clustering methods on the labeled yeast
              gene expression dataset. Furthermore we showed that it is better
              in identifying the functionally common clusters than k-means on
              the unlabeled human gene expression dataset. The results
              demonstrate that our new deep learning architecture could
              generalize well the specific properties of gene expression
              profiles. Furthermore, the results confirm our hypothesis that
              the prior biological network knowledge could be helpful in the
              gene expression clustering task.",

  author   = "Spill, Yannick G and Castillo, David and Marti-Renom, Marc A",
  abstract = "3C-like experiments, such as 4C or Hi-C, have been fundamental in
              understanding genome organization. Thanks to these technologies,
              it is now known, for example, that Topologically Associating
              Domains (TADs) and chromatin loops are implicated in the dynamic
              interplay of gene activation and repression, and their disruption
              can have dramatic effects on embryonic development. To make their
              detection easier, scientists have endeavored into deeper
              sequencing to mechanically increase the chances to detect weaker
              signals such as chromatin loops. Part of this mindset can be
              attributed to the limitations of existing software: the analysis
              of Hi-C experiments is both statistically and computationally
              demanding. Here, we devise a new way to represent Hi-C data,
              which leads to a more detailed classification of paired-end reads
              and, ultimately, to a new normalization and interaction detection
              method. Unlike any other, Binless is resolution-agnostic, and
              adapts to the quality and quantity of available data. We
              demonstrate its capacities to call interactions and differences
              and make the software freely available.",

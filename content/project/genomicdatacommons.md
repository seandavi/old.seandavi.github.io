The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has established
the [Genomic Data Commons](https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/) (GDC). The GDC
provides the cancer research community with an open and unified
repository for sharing and accessing data across numerous cancer
studies and projects via a high-performance data transfer and query
infrastructure. The *GenomicDataCommons* Bioconductor package provides
basic infrastructure for querying, accessing, and mining genomic
datasets available from the GDC. We expect that the Bioconductor
developer and the larger bioinformatics communities will build on the
*GenomicDataCommons* package to add higher-level functionality and
expose cancer genomics data to the plethora of state-of-the-art
bioinformatics methods available in Bioconductor.

abstract = "New technologies allow for genome-scale measurement of DNA methylation. In an effort to increase the clinical utility of DNA methylation as a biomarker, we have adapted a commercial bisulfite epigenotyping assay for genome-wide methylation profiling in archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pathology specimens. This chapter takes the reader step by step through a biomarker discovery experiment to identify phenotype-correlated DNA methylation signatures in routine pathology specimens."

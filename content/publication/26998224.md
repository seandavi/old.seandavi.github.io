abstract = "Bioconductor ( bioconductor.org) is a rich source of software and know-how for the integrative analysis of genomic data. The Bioconductor channel in F1000Research provides a forum for task-oriented workflows that cover a solution to a current, important problem in genome-scale data analysis. It also hosts manuscripts describing software packages, package-based vignettes, teaching labs, benchmark studies, methodological reviews and bioinformatics software oriented perspective papers."
